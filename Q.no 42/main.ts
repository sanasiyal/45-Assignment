// Q.no 42... Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

let magicians:string[] = ["herry poter" , "ron weasley" , "albatros"]

function make_great(magicianArray:string[]){
    for(let i=0; i<magicianArray.length; i++){
        magicians[i] = "the great"+ " " + magicianArray[i]
    }
}

function show_magicians(magicians:string[]){
    magicians.forEach(element => {
        console.log(element);
        
    });
}

make_great(magicians);
show_magicians(magicians)
